There's something exciting about electric vehicles that I can't quite
articulate. I think it has _something_ to do with my interest in decentralized
systems (everyone can have their own solar panels to charge it, while not
everyone can have an oil refinery for gas), or maybe it's simply the allure of a
field still in it's exploratory phases. Either way, I'm enamored with both the
idea and the current phsyical implementation of them. So, of course, I had to
get one.

After a year, and 7,000 miles of driving, I'm confident in saying that while my
next vehicle may not be a Tesla, it is most certainly going to be electric.

I took delivery of my Tesla Model 3 back in May 2019, after being a reservation
holder since the reveal back in 2016. I had waited so long in fear of a) Tesla
unable to effectively ramp up production and falling in on itself, leaving me
with a support-less car and b) widespread issues plaguing the 3 during
"production hell". I probably would've waited longer, but my hand was forced
after a car crash totalled my daily driver at the time.

## My Experience with Roadtrips

I live in NYC, so I don't do a lot of commute driving, as I take public
transportation for that. A bulk amount of the miles I've placed on the car have
been from "trips": road trips, ski trips, camping trips, etc. I think this puts
me at odds with a "typical" electric vehicle owner, as I see _a lot_ of the
persuasive conversations rooted in how great EVs are for work commutes and how
"leaving every day with a full tank of gas" is so beneficial. But since I street
park, and I don't use a car to commute to work, those arguments didn't mean much
to me. On the contrary, I don't see a whole lot of "EVs are great roadtrip cars!
You get to stop every so often for a 30 minute recharge!" arguments being made
to potential EV owners, but probably the most convincing argument for
me to grab an EV.

I love road trips, but I'm not a road warrior. I don't find it very fun to drive
ten hours straight with no break. Even with gas cars, I probably drove 2-3 hours
before taking a 20 minute rest-stop break.
